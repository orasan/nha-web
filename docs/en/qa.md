# Q&A
## Frequently Asked Questions
### What prompted you to create a server?

I originally ran a 2b2t-related server called Minianarchy after the 2b2tjp administrator abused his privileges. However, due to the numerous clone servers and the relatively popular test server, I decided to continue running it.

### Isn't an anarchy server where cheating isn't allowed really an anarchy server?

The essence of an anarchy server is "few rules," not whether cheating is allowed or not. While building destruction and PvP are free on this server, cheating is prohibited as it disrupts the game balance. Think of it as "anarchy that maintains fairness in survival."

### Where is the server hosted?

I'm renting a server in Hokkaido, Japan.
### The server is laggy! TPS is low!

I'm sorry. Due to financial and other reasons, I haven't been able to improve the hardware performance much, and I apologize for that...
### What should I do if I receive an unfair ban?

Currently, I'm the only person making the decisions, so there may be occasional incorrect bans.

No. However, if due to my carelessness or for some other reason the world needs to be reset, I apologize, but there is a possibility that it may be reset.
